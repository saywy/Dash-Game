# üçÄ Cube Stories 
**Some information about the game and how to use it correctly**

----

**Cube Stories** This is an application developed by three developers. This is our first pygame project. Inspired by the popular Geometry Dash game, we decided to create something similar in python and pygame. Only you can evaluate whether we succeeded or not!

You can contact the developers of the game [here](https://t.me/+bu4MPCK4cbQ5MTgy)

## Running/Building
**You will require main.py to debug and run this project.**

The main project file is the main file.py in the src directory. There is also a file here constance.py , in which you can track certain constant values. 

The rest of the character class files are located in the models directory. Here you can take a closer look at each of the classes of the main player. The dos and assets directories contain additional files.

To debug it, you will need to properly clone or pull this repository.

## Future plans

Unfortunately, I doubt that we will ever be able to get together and finalize this project together. Yes, it's pretty raw now, but it's still playable. In the future, the project can be updated and used to train neural networks to play geometry dash. And now it's just a cool first experience writing a game using the pygame library.

## Other using

This code can be used to write other projects. If you do this, please write your idea to the Telegram group. If there is a person willing to finish what we started, we will be extremely happy, and we will provide all the information about the project that we have on our own without any problems.
